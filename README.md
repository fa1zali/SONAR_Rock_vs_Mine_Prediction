### Project Title
**SONAR: Rock vs Mine Prediction**

### Description
Logistic Regression is a regression approach used for predicting only two possible values.
For this project, we will be building a machine learning model to classify whether the object is a *Rock* or a *Mine* through the SONAR data. Our goal is to work through this notebook by collecting data, preprocessing it, splitting it into testing and training datasets, train the model and evaluate the accuracy of our model.

### Files used
We used the following dataset available on Kaggle to work on this project:

* [sonar-mine-data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mayurdalvi/sonar-mine-dataset)

This file contains various data column which consist of sonar data. Last column tells us weather it has found a *Rock* or a *Mine*.
Target Column consist of:
* R -> Rock
* M -> Mine
